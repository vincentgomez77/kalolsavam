This year’s edition is happening after a 3-year-break forced by the pandemic.  

While it began in 1957 with just a few hundred participants and a modest crowd, this year’s main venue at Captain Vikram Maidan in Kozhikode can seat 12,000 spectators. 

Some events like Oppana attracted crowds of more than 18,000 there.  

And the 239 events are being held at 24 different school venues across the city.  

Moreover, a food pavilion managed by the veteran chef Pazhayidom Mohanan Namboothiri, that can feed more than 17,000 people a day, has also been set up.   

However, it is much more than just a big event</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:50px;line-height:30px;">For thousands of students in schools with the Kerala State syllabus, it is the ultimate stage to compete against the best performers from across Kerala.  

Renowned Mohiniyattam dancer Methil Devika, who won prizes for classical dance at sub-district and district level of the festival, wrote in a recent column for The Hindu that she was intimidated by the quality of the competition at the 1991 Festival she participated in.  

She says for young artistes, there is no bigger opportunity.  

Several well-known actors, dancers and musicians from Kerala had their first date with fame at the festival.  

Those names include singers K.J. Yesudas, P. Jayachandran, K.S. Chitra, Sujatha, Minmini, Srinivas, Venugopal and Harisankar as well as actors Manju Warrier, Navya Nair and Vineeth. 

Actor, singer and filmmaker Vineeth Sreenivasan, who made the blockbuster Hridayam this year, is a winner as a singer at the Kalolsavam</p>
